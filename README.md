# Host-aware modelling of microbial physiology

Heterologous gene expression draws resources from host cells. These resources include vital components to sustain growth and replication, and the resulting *cellular burden* is a widely recognised bottleneck in the design of robust circuits. 

This repo implements computational models that integrate gene circuits into the physiology of *Escherichia coli* host cells.
